# lazy-product-slideshow

Found issues:
1. provided JSON was incorrect (no double quotes for keys);
2. images can have different ratios (e.g. Nike Air Max 97);
3. no h1 on designs (it should be visible otherwise it's a violation). Didn't add as assume that I've made just part of the page.
4. very long time on images response, issues of The Sole Supplier CMS CDN;

If there would be more time/requirements than:

would add prop types checking + default prop values with Prop Types;
would add prettier, eslint;
would add all tests;
would make a re-factoring;
would fix bugs;
